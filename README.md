# Snowflake_Spark_Connection
Connecting snowflake to spark(python)

Before you can learn the steps for connecting Snowflake to Python, a major requirement is to install the Snowflake Connector for Python. This Connector delivers the interface for developing Python applications that can connect to a Cloud Data Warehouse and perform standard functions.

The Snowflake Python Connector is a Python package that readily connects your application to Snowflake and has no dependencies on JDBC or ODBC. It is essential for connecting Snowflake to Python and it supports all standard operations. For example, query execution, loading, accessing data from an external source, and many more.

It also provides a programming alternative to developing applications in Java or C/C++ using the Snowflake JDBC or ODBC drivers. It is supported on the most popular operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms where Python 3.5.0 (or higher) is installed.

SnowSQL, the command line client to use SQL, provided by Snowflake, is one of the applications developed using the connector. Once this Connector is installed, you can use it for connecting Snowflake to Pytho
